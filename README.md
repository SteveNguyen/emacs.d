# My emacs config circa 2025

Made to be:
- Portable (with use-package and straight)
- fast
- programming oriented

Some external dependencies:
- clangd (lsp-mode)
- rust-analyzer (lsp-mode)
- npm (copilot-mode)
- ...

The very first loading will take some time as packages will be downloaded and compiled.
